# Voice Tic Tac Toe
* This source code works with Apex functions on AWS.
* The source code is an interfaced to https://www.npmjs.com/package/tic-tac-toe-ai-engine
* The source code is in a very raw state. When this was built I opted for just getting it done vs. readability.

# Wish list
* General readability improvements
* Add a level that is called annoying that will tell the user when he/she lost before the game is over.

I plan to refactor in the open. If you have any suggestions, send a feature request or pull request.
Don't shy away from criticizing! My hope is that I get input from other people on the readability and design.
